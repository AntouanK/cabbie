Develop a program that, given a series of points (latitude, longitude and timestamp) of a cab journey retrieved from a GPS, will disregard potentially erroneous points. 

We expect the resulting code to be correct, readable, concise, modular and object oriented.

It will have to run in a modern browser. Using 3rd party libraries is welcome but remember we want to see your skills :)

The attached dataset is provided as an example, with a png of the 'cleaned' route as a guide.

Please return your answer as a single zip file.
